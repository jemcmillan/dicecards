        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Experience design and creating a user experience refers
          to designing digital or physical products, services and
          socially engaging journeys, events or displays that are
          immersive and user focused. This could mean how someone
          moves through a tour, an art show or display booths;
          how users look at information graphics; or how users navigate
           a website or app.</p>
        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>Does the content have a clear beginning, middle and end?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No one likes to stand in lines or to have to “hurry up and wait.” The content or experience should have a clearly demarcated beginning, middle and end. It is important to get to the point in your story before you lose the audience.</li>
            <li>During the beginning of a tour or activity, the more someone has to wait, the more impatient they will tend to become. Therefore, you should communicate why they are waiting. People in line are also a captive audience — what can you do with them in those moments to enhance their learning experience?</li>
            <li>Streamline the experience, avoiding obstacles or unclear directions that could distract or confuse the user.</li>
            <li>Have a clear ending, wrapping up the experience in a manner that is obvious to the user. In addition, is there something physical or digital (e.g., pamphlets, photographs) the user can take with them so that they may extend the experience after they have left?</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Intensity</h3>
          <p>How will you engage with your intended audience?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The experience should be free flowing as much as possible. Nothing should interfere with the user’s learning experience or their ability to complete tasks. Each step of the journey should take minimal explanation and effort to move from one stage to the next.</li>
            <li>Is the experience socially engaging? Who is your audience? Is your customer an active participant, or are they excluded due to ability, gender or age? Keep these issues in mind in order to engage your user effectively.</li>
            <li>Think about the experience or engagement you are designing. How do you want the target audience to feel? What is the required intensity to achieve the desired effect?</li>
            <li>As the designer of the experience or engagement, you control the intensity to match the target audience and the desired goal.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Breadth</h3>
            <p>Is your solution goal focused? What is the brand intent?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify what you want your viewer to gain from the experience.</li>
              <li>Solve for why. You or your team should begin any project with a clear statement of why you are doing the project a certain way and why it is valuable to the customer.</li>
              <li>Solve the how. Once you have the “why” it is time to figure out how to solve the customer’s need. What solutions can you provide that will reflect the brand and still be of value for the customer?</li>
              <li>Every project should have an end goal or objective. Identify your end goal for your UX and how you want your brand to reflect that end goal.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <p>Is your solution customer centric? What are the Affordances, Signifiers and Feedback?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Affordances.</b> As Andy Sontag describes them in the 5E Experience Design Model, “Affordances are clues about how an object should be used, typically provided by the object itself or its context.” For example, imagine you are setting up a booth at an air show. You have a few screens standing by to play videos highlighting your ship’s mission. The affordance is that your screens can play videos.</li>
                <li><b>Signifiers.</b> If affordances determine what actions are possible, signifiers communicate where that action takes place. The signifier of the videos you have set up in the air show example above is the play button on the screen showing the viewer where to click to start a video.</li>
                <li><b>Feedback.</b> Users should receive prompt feedback on their actions so that they know the content or experience is working properly. Feedback that is not immediate, or poorly designed, can cause people to give up on the experience entirely out of confusion and/or frustration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your users or customers need the signifiers and feedback in your Experience Design. Always consider using signifiers to direct your audience, even on your command’s social media pages, to ensure that your pages are easy to understand and navigate. This also applies to activities during a ship’s tour. Do the activities provide feedback to the participant so they know it is working? Use constraints to keep people on the right path of the experience, literally and figuratively.</p>

            <h3>Triggers</h3>
              <p>Does your solution indulge the senses and create an emotional response?</p>
              <p>According to Whitney Hess, “Ease of use isn’t the only measure of a positive user experience; pleasurably is just as important. Something can be dead simple, but if it’s outrageously boring or cold it can feel harder to get through. Designs should have flourishes of warmth, kindness, whimsy,
                richness, seduction, wit — anything that incites passion and makes the person feel engaged and energized.”
                According to Don Norman’s Three Levels of Design, we process information and emotion in three ways:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Visceral.</b> The visceral level is the most basic level of processing. It is how we make quick judgments about a situation, e.g.,
                    good or bad, safe or dangerous. It responds to the immediate present in which the emotions that come up are unaffected by context or history.
                    No cause, blame, or credit is assigned to the reaction.
                    <p>Don Norman writes in 'The Design of Everyday Things':</p>
                    <p><em>For designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or the jarring, irritating scratch of fingernails on a rough surface. Here is where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses.</em></p></li>
                  <li><b>Behavioral.</b> The behavioral level of processing is the home of learned skills. Actions, reactions and analysis at this level are mostly subconscious.
                    If people have a good understanding and knowledge of the expected outcome, the behavioral states will make them feel in control. However, people may feel frustration
                    and anger when things don’t go as planned, especially when neither the reason nor the possible remedies are known.
                    <p>Norman writes:</p>
                    <p><em>For designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is that every action is associated with an expectation. Expect a positive outcome and the result is a positive affective response (a “positive valence,” in the scientific literature). Expect a negative outcome and the result is a negative affective response (a negative valence): dread and hope, anxiety and anticipation.</em></p>
                    </li>
                  <li><b>Reflective.</b> The reflective level of processing where conscious cognition happens.
                    This is where reasoning, conscious decision-making and understanding develop.
                    Visceral and behavioral levels are subconscious, so they respond rapidly.
                    Reflection is cognitive, more analytical and slower, often occurring long after an event has occurred or a product has been viewed.
                    <p>Norman again:</p>
                    <p><em>To the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the levels of processing. Reflection is conscious, and the emotions produced at this level are the most protracted: those that assign agency and cause, such as guilt and blame or praise and pride. … Reflective memories are often more important than reality. If we have a strongly positive visceral response but disappointing usability problems at the behavioral level, when we reflect back upon the product, the reflective level might very well weigh the positive response strongly enough to overlook the severe behavioral difficulties.</em></p>
                  </li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Significance</h3>
              <p>Does the experience designed convey credibility and trustworthiness?
                You have to earn the confidence of your customer. Do not over-promise and under-deliver. Set a clear expectation of what you can and cannot provide. Meet the deadlines you set and do what you say you are going to do. Communicate with the customer if anything happens that may affect meeting expectations.
                How long will that video or photo project take you? How long can people expect your tour or activity experience to take? Communication is key to managing expectations and the user experience.
